In the third phase you should create a brief summary of your results. 
Try to make it easy to understand for non-specialist. 
We will host a guest that will help to give feedback related to these analyses.


Your results are not brief. They have similar length as the second phase.

You have included a lot of plots. 
But they are not consistent (different color palettes) 
and they are not rich in information.
Just 9 bars for 9 numbers. 
You loose whole page to present 9 numbers.

Additional enumeration of plots or sections will help to share comments.
For example, in the plot above 'Analysis of clusters', you use a lot of vertical space without any good reason for it (a lot of empty space) and data that is hard to read anyway.

Histograms in the section 'Analysis of clusters' have different OX axes and it is hard to compare them.

Plots for the 'optimal' number of clusters are huge, but they present only little fraction of information (that optimal number of clusters is 4-5).
Also one would expect that the discussion what is the optimal number of clusters will go before the final clustering.
