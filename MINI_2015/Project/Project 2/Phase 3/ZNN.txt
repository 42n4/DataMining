Task:
In the third phase you should create a brief summary of your results. 
Try to make it easy to understand for non-specialist. 
We will host a guest that will help to give a feedback related to these analyses.


The for of presentation was a good idea (you could do such presentation in R with Rpres).
The structure was good.
Things that you could improve are related to data concentration on each slide.
In most cases you can add one sentence to each plot (with key point. You have such information in comments but not on slide)
and in case of barplots you could present more information on them (see slides 4-7)

Points
20/25
