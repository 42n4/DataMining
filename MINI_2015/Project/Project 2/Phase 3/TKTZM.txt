Task:
In the third phase you should create a brief summary of your results. 
Try to make it easy to understand for non-specialist. 
We will host a guest that will help to give an feedback related to these analyses.

Good new results (in comparison to the previous phase).

But the report is not brief.
The structure is not easy to follow (numeration of plots / sections will be useful).

Plots should be richer in content, now you have a lot of barplots, that are large and present just few numbers. 
It is hard to compare numbers between different plots.

The plots with colors are a bit better, but the axis is hard to read.

I think that more information could be extracted from the data, than profiles related to interaction time and stations visited.
