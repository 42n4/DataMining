Task:
In the third phase you should create a brief summary of your results. 
Try to make it easy to understand for non-specialist. 
We will host a guest that will help to give feedback related to these analyses.

Except the introduction, nothing has changed. 
You have not prepared any summary, not even add comments from the previous phase.
