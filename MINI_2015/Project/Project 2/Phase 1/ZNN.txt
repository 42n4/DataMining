1. What is the average (or distribution) time of interaction with a given machine

Something is wrong with times that you have presented.
Note that in other groups times are very different.
Here you have all times in interval 0-1.

Analyses for number of visitors are correct, but all results for times are not.


2. Is there a relation between the duration of an interaction and variables like weekday or hour

There is a lot of results and conclusions. I like these proportions.

As in the point 1, there is something wrong with time intervals.
But results for number of visitors are correct.

You have a lot of plots, some of them may be presented as tables. This will make it easier to precisely read data from plots.

4/7 + 6/7 + 1 = 11
