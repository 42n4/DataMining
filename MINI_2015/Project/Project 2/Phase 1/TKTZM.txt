Your report is very similar to report prepared by MSKK.
Some plots are exactly the same.
Note that such similarities in further phases will result in negative points.



1. What is the average (or distribution) time of interaction with a given machine

There is no reason to include warnings and messages in the report. 
You can save a lot of space, and make the report much easier to read if you remove warnings from 'Loading data and necessary libraries'

I do not know why you have removed long visits (longer than 400 sec).
Instead or removing these rows you could use median rather than mean, or replace these large values with 400sec cut off.
Now you loose information about long visits at all.


2. Is there a relation between the duration of an interaction and variables like weekday or hour

You have included a lot of results and plots.
But conclusions are very short. Where are conclusions for all these plots? Do they bring any interesting information?
