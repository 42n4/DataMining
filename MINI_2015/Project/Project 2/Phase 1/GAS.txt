You should introduce some numbering of plots.
Right now, without numbering of pages, plots or sections, it is hard to refer to any of your results.



1. What is the average (or distribution) time of interaction with a given machine

You have plotted distributions per station and this is good.
But since these distributions are not normalized (counts instead of proportions) and are on different panels, it is very hard to compare them.
You've written 'All the distributions of time interaction of stations tend to have the same shape' but actually distribution for cnk2 and cnk3 looks very different.
Even simple characteristics like median/ first quartile /third quartile should reveal if there are differences between machines or there are not.


2. Is there a relation between the duration of an interaction and variables like weekday or hour

You've tested many variables, like hour of the day, day of the week, scene.
You have presented these relations with the use of plots. This is good idea if plots are informative.
Right now, having these distributions not normalized you cannot compare effects of different hour.
There are a lot of colours but no information can be derived from this plot
Either you shall consider different graphical presentations or numerical summaries.


So I like these plots, but they are not informative enough. Try to add some numerical summaries or normalize histograms.

I do not really understand your conclusions. What are the ‘moralities’?
