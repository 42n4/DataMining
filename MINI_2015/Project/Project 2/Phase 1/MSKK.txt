Your report is very similar to report prepared by TKTZM.
Some plots are exactly the same.
Note that such similarities in further phases will result in negative points.



1. What is the average (or distribution) time of interaction with a given machine

As you have noticed, the distribution of time is very skewed. 
Thus median is better than average. Yet you have a lot of averages in the first part.

Moreover, boxplots are good to compare distributions (between groups like hour/day).
Boxplot for only one distribution is not informative.

I like the first histogram. I think that it is the best plot in your report. Would be nice to see this distribution for different groups.

2. Is there a relation between the duration of an interaction and variables like weekday or hour

I like your second part with medians and plots.
You shall add tables as well to support plots.

Conclusions are fine as well.
