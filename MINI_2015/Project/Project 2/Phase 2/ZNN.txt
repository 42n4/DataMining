It is hard to refer to specific plots or results, since they are not named.
Please include some hooks, numbers or names for results, will be much easier to comment them.

Technically your solution is correct.
But there are not related to behaviors of visitors but rather to time of visit (like starting hour ending hour).
Or date of visit. Such variables are not that useful to identify segments of visitors.

Also you have a lot of similar results, but without strong selection.

It will be much better to put 80% of your results to he appendix, and leave only the 20% but the one that are the most important.



1. How to define the similarity measure between visitors?

Here it's mostly based on the length of interaction and starting/ending hour.
You could consider much more variables, like stations that have been visited, order of visits, average time per station and so on.


2. Is the population homogenous or heterogonous? If heterogeneous then how many groups you can derive/define?

Your groups are based on the time and the length of the visit.
You have also considered pages that were observed, but these results were not merged and these are two separate groupings.

Thinking about 'profile' and 'behavior' it might be useful to take into account also other features.

3. How to characterize different groups of visitors?

In conclusions you have presented four clusters. 
All of them are characterized only based on time / length of the visit.


4. Is there a pattern in stations that visitor tends to visit?

You have analyzed only four stations. 
There are differences between cluster 1 and cluster 2 in terms of distribution of stations.
Bus such comments / characteristics are not presented in the point 'Stations in each Cluster' nor in conclusions.
