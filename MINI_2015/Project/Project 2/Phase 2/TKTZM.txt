You have used only very basic variables to find clusters (no. sessions, avg interaction time with sessions)



1. How to define the similarity measure between visitors?

Five interesting measures, you should do a single clustering for all these measures.


2. Is the population homogenous or heterogonous. If heterogeneous then how many groups you can derive/define?

I do not know why you have created few different clustering instead of one.
Out of these 5 variables you could create one clustering and describe it.
Instead of having different clusters based on two variables each.


3. How to characterize different groups of visitors?

Nothing concrete.
Just summaries like 'certain groups prefer only certain machines'.
How to draw any conclusion from 'something is different than something else' 


4. Is there a pattern in stations that visitor tends to visit?

There are different clusterings. 
So you have performed one for stations and then you were looking for patterns based on this clustering only.
I would expect one global clustering and then it will be interesting to see if patterns of visits are different for different stations.
