The introduction with warnings and messages looks very very bad.
Without this mess this will be a very good report.
But all these warnings and messages really spoils your results.

On the other hand, the summary and conclusions are good


1. How to define the similarity measure between visitors?

You have identified many interesting variables.

The station path is a very interesting concept. But you do not present results for it carefully. Just a table with frequent paths.


2. Is the population homogenous or heterogonous. If heterogeneous then how many groups you can derive/define?

You answer correctly but I could not find any arguments for this.
Like a plot that shows how some measure is changing with different number of clusters. Then It will be easier to see if 1 cluster is much worse than 4.

3. How to characterize different groups of visitors?

Very good characterization in conclusions.

4. Is there a pattern in stations that visitor tends to visit?

You have presented some statistics and groups of stations.
But you could present the flow of visitors in a better way.

5/5 + 2/5 + 5/5 + 4/5  = 16
