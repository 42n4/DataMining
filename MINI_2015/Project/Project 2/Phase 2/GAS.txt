Your conclusions are very short, and you do not cover most of questions are are scored.
There is no introduction and it is hard to follow what and why you have done it.

WSS stands for Within Sum of Squares 

These machines are not gaming machines, these are stations in science center.


1. How to define the similarity measure between visitors?

You have not explained how this is done.
I can guess only based on R code that it is related to scales dummy variables for stations and /scene/interaction.


2. Is the population homogenous or heterogonous? If heterogeneous then how many groups you can derive/define?

You have found 4 clusters, but from WSS plot actually the k=5 will be much better.


3. How to characterize different groups of visitors?

You have presented PCA for clusters, but there is no information how your base characteristics are related with PCA dimensions.

The characteristics in point 'Inference - KMeans Results' are not complete.
I would expect that for each cluster you will add some specific explanation what is characteristic for it.


4. Is there a pattern in stations that visitor tends to visit?


I have not found any exploration of the patterns in typical visits.
