1. Is the approach correct?

The approach is correct but is not described anywhere. 
You should add short paragraph that describes the 'Methodology/pipeline' that you have used.
 
You should invest more in the feature analysis part.
Not there si only one plot and one table.

2. How good is the classifier?

Accuracy of the last classifier is 81.8% (I assume that this is the final model)

3. Quality of the report?

There is Table of contents and introduction, but:

Introduction is just one line. 
There is no summary.
You are not starting sentences with capital letter.
There is a lot of results but without comments.


Others

You should include the short overview of obtained results on the beginning / bottom of the report.

You should look more carefully on features.

Points
3/5 + 5/5 + 2/5 = 10
