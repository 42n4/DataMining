1. Is the approach correct?


In general yes. 
Good that you have short overview of methodology.

You should add more comments / summary of obtained results.

2. How good is the classifier?

Accuracy of the final model is 77.3 %


3. Quality of the report?

Missing parts: page numbers, table of contents.

In figures you are using a) and b) but there is no such marking in the plot.
The boxplots and barplots that you have used are hard to compare (you have different range on different plots).
Graphical presentation of features is a very good idea, but here these plots are not that informative.



Others

Avoid reports that are hard to reproduce. 
If you have to use Word, generate it with some other tool.
