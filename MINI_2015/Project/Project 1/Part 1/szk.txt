1. Is the approach correct?

There is very little about feature selection / engineering.
You should present more about data summaries (here there is just first few rows).


2. How good is the classifier?

You have not presented explicitly how good is the final classifier
(which is the final one).
I guess that best results are for RF and you have presented accuracy only for k-nn and it's 74.2%

3. Quality of the report?

The summary has only one line and do not summarizes anything.

There are no comments related to obtained results.

In the report you have some random messages like 

## Następujący obiekt został zakryty z 'package:stats':



Points
2/5 + 3/5 + 2/5 = 7
