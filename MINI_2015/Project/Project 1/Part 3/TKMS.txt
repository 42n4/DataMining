Overall the report is good. It is readable and figures help to understand the content.
But there is lack of feature engineering or deeper tuning for different classifiers. 

1. Number of classifiers. Try 10 or more different classifiers. Do not limit yourself to classifiers that we have discussed during classes. With the ‘train’ function you can try many different classifiers.

12 classifiers were considered (good thing).
Lack of normalisation of variables that is specific for classifiers (e.g. for naive Bayes, bad thing).
Lack of tuning of variables that is specific for classifiers (bad thing).


2. Quality of recommendations. Conclusive report should have recommendations like: best classifiers are: worst are: Best features are: Worst are:

You have presented a ranking for both variables and classifiers.
However you shall try to create a ranking for variables for the best classifier (here treebag). 
Now you use variables selected as best for random forest, but in recommendations you point treebag as a better choice.


3. Quality of the report (should be short with conclusions). Important points: what performance you can reach with different classifiers. Is there summary (graphical or tabular).

Report is readable and the structure is well prepared.
