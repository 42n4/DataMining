Projects:
---------

You may work on projects in a group of 2-4 people. You cannot work with same person in both projects.
You will present your results during classes, but you should submit your solution to GitHub before classes.
Projects that are not presented will not be scores. 
Al least 50% of the team is required to be present during the project presentation.

Grade:
------

Final grade will be based on points from projects (each project id 15+20+25 points, different number of points for each phase of the project) and home works (each home work is for 4 points).


Homeworks:
----------
There will be some home works after some classes (around 10 home works).
Each correct solution gives you 4 points.
Home works have to be done personally. No group work here!
Home works have to be submitted to github not later than 1 week after announcement.
