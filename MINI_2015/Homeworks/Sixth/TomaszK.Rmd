#Loading and preparing data
```{r}
winesb <- read.table("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv", sep=";", header=TRUE)
winesb$quality <- factor(ifelse(winesb$quality > 5, "good", "bad")) 
```

#Applying k-folds Cross Validation to LDA/QDA
```{r}
library(caret)

train_control <- trainControl(method="cv", number=10)

mat <- sapply(c('lda', 'qda'), function (met) {
  modelFit<- train(quality~., method=met,preProcess=c('scale', 'center'), data=winesb, trControl=train_control)
  confusionMatrix(winesb$quality, predict(modelFit, winesb))$overall
})

round(mat*100,2)
```

#Comment
The accuracy as well as kappa of LDA is slightly better than those of QDA (74.55 vs 74.42), this could point to a conclusion that for wines data set this discriminant analysis is more suitable because of linear character of data classification.
