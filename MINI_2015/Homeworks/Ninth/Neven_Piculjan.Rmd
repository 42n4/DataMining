# The Homework
  
Choose only deputies from two largest parties (PO and PiS).

Choose only important votings (these on which more than 75\% of deputies are present).

Check which deputies from party X have votes more similar to deputies from party B.

Show the dendrogram for selected deputies and use colours to present different parties.
