# The Homework

Download the dataset `adult` (find more about this dataset here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/). 
Train a decision tree and a random forest. 
Compare performance of both methods. 

Take some time to find variables that are not used by anyone else (sumbissions with same set of variables will not be scored).

```{r}
data = read.table("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data",
        sep=",",header=F,col.names=c("age", "type_employer", "fnlwgt", "education", 
                "education_num","marital", "occupation", "relationship", "race","sex",
                "capital_gain", "capital_loss", "hr_per_week","country", "income"),
        fill=FALSE,strip.white=T)
head(data,3)

```

#Solution

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Loading the library
library(rpart)

# Fitting and plotting a tree
rtree <- rpart(income~hr_per_week+race+sex+occupation+education, data = data)
rtree
plot(rtree)
text(rtree)

# Predict table
table(real = data$income,
      predicted = predict(rtree, data=data, type = "class"))

# Mean
mean(data$income ==
       predict(rtree, data=data, type = "class"))

# Loading the library
library(randomForest)

# Fitting Random Forest
ffit <- randomForest(income~hr_per_week+race+sex+occupation+education,   data=data, importance = TRUE)

# Performance of Random Forest
print(ffit) 
importance(ffit)
varImpPlot(ffit)

```
