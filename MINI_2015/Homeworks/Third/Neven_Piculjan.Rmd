# The Homework

Download the dataset `adult` (find more about this dataset here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/). 
Train a decision tree and a random forest. 
Compare performance of both methods. 

Take some time to find variables that are not used by anyone else (sumbissions with same set of variables will not be scored).

```{r}
data = read.table("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data",
        sep=",",header=F,col.names=c("age", "type_employer", "fnlwgt", "education", 
                "education_num","marital", "occupation", "relationship", "race","sex",
                "capital_gain", "capital_loss", "hr_per_week","country", "income"),
        fill=FALSE,strip.white=T)
head(data,3)

```

#Solution

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Decision tree
library(party)

# Fitting a tree
tr <- ctree(income~age+type_employer+education+marital+capital_gain+hr_per_week+country, data=data)

# Plotting a tree
plot(tr)

# Performance of decision tree
table(real = data$income,
      predicted = predict(tr))

# Random Forest
library(randomForest)

# Fitting Random Forest
ffit <- randomForest(income~age+type_employer+education+marital+capital_gain+hr_per_week+country,   data=data, importance = TRUE)

# Performance of Random Forest
print(ffit) 
```
